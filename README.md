# ichack26

This branch contains initial prototypes for the webpage. Originally, the UI involved 3 columns: a map where the user selects a location, a sketchpad where they draw their image, then a map where their route will be displayed. Some debugging functionality at the bottom of the webpage has been left in. The package used can be found here: https://github.com/tyrasd/osmtogeojson (all credits to original author).
